# module-1-project

_Hello!_ 

_This project is about my very first refactoring code._

_Here I have went in and got rid of those pesky div's and instead replaced them with the proper HTML elements._

_I have also went into the CSS and changed some of the names._

_As for the title, I adjusted it to display the proper name for this website._
